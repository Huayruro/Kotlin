Open the arduino-1.x.x folder just created by the extraction process and spot the install.sh file. Right click on it and choose Run in Terminal from the contextual menu. The installation process will quickly end and you should find a new icon on your desktop.

If you don't find the option to run the script from the contextual menu, you have to open a Terminal window and move into the arduino-1.x.x root directory and run the following command:
sudo sh install.sh

Start the ROS Master - roscore
Run rosserial client on the machine - rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/tty<USB# or ACM#>
The serial port is determined at run time for either ttyUSB or ttyACM. The exact port number can be found from the Arduino IDE or using dmesg | grep tty.
Read published data returning if the button is pressed on the Arduino board or not - rostopic echo button_press
Publish data to toggle the LED connected on the Arduino - rostopic pub toggle_led std_msgs/UInt16 "data: 0" The data is “0” to switch off the LED and “1” to switch on the LED.

Use multiple terminal tabs to execute instructions and observe the response in the same screen
