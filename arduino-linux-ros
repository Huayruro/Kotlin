sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosserial
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosserial-arduino


Start the ROS Master - roscore
Run rosserial client on the machine - rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/tty<USB# or ACM#>
The serial port is determined at run time for either ttyUSB or ttyACM. The exact port number can be found from the Arduino IDE or using dmesg | grep tty.
Read published data returning if the button is pressed on the Arduino board or not - rostopic echo button_press
Publish data to toggle the LED connected on the Arduino - rostopic pub toggle_led std_msgs/UInt16 "data: 0" The data is “0” to switch off the LED and “1” to switch on the LED.

Use multiple terminal tabs to execute instructions and observe the response in the same screen
